# Trafic-Violation

This project involves analyzing traffic violation data to uncover patterns and insights. The goal is to visualize the data, understand trends, and provide meaningful conclusions about traffic stops and related violations.

## Project Description

Traffic violations are a common occurrence, and analyzing this data can provide insights into the effectiveness of law enforcement, potential biases, and areas for improvement. This project utilizes Python libraries such as pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib to process and visualize traffic violation data.

## Data

The data used in this project includes information about traffic stops, searches conducted, and whether the stops were drug-related. The main features in the dataset are:
- `search_conducted`: Number of searches conducted during traffic stops
- `drugs_related_stop`: Number of stops related to drugs
- `Not involved in drugs`: Calculated as `search_conducted - drugs_related_stop`

## Usage

1. **Prepare your data:** Ensure your data is in a CSV file format and is placed in the `data` directory.

2. **Heatmap visualization:**
    The analysis script will generate a heatmap visualizing the traffic violation data. Ensure your data is clean and all values are numeric to avoid errors.
